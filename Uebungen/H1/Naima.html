    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>Love sushi, but feel intimated by the idea of making sushi at home?
    <br>Don’t be! As a Japanese home cook,
    <br>I’m here to assure you that everyone can make solid, beautiful sushi in their own kitchen.
    <br> And oftentimes, it requires just a few ingredients and basic techniques. You’ll only get better with practice!</p>
    
    <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
    <p>Sushi, a traditional Japanese dish enjoyed worldwide, is not just about the art of rolling rice and fish; it's a delicate balance of flavors and textures. Before diving into the culinary adventure of making sushi at home, proper preparation is key.
    1. Gathering Ingredients:<br>
    Begin by gathering the essential ingredients. These typically include sushi rice, nori (seaweed sheets), fresh fish or other fillings like avocado, cucumber, or crab, and condiments such as soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger.<br><br>

    2. Selecting Fresh Ingredients:<br>
    Quality is paramount in sushi. When selecting fish, ensure it's fresh and suitable for raw consumption. Opt for sushi-grade fish, available at reputable fishmongers or specialty stores. Freshness guarantees the best flavor and texture.<br><br>

    3. Preparing Sushi Rice:<br>
    Sushi rice is the foundation of any sushi dish. Rinse the rice thoroughly to remove excess starch, then cook it to perfection. A rice cooker is handy for achieving the ideal texture—sticky yet firm. After cooking, season the rice with a mixture of rice vinegar, sugar, and salt, gently folding to distribute evenly while preserving the rice's integrity.<br><br>

    4. Slicing Fillings:<br>
    If using fish or vegetables as fillings, ensure they're sliced thinly and uniformly. This ensures that each bite of sushi has a harmonious balance of flavors and textures. Precision in slicing is crucial for both aesthetics and taste.<br><br>

    5. Setting Up the Workstation:<br>
    Create a clean and organized workspace. Lay out bamboo sushi mats, nori sheets, bowls of water for wetting hands (to prevent rice sticking), and all prepared ingredients within easy reach. A sharp knife for slicing sushi rolls is essential for clean cuts.<br><br>

    6. Mastering Rolling Techniques:<br>
    Rolling sushi is an art form that requires practice. Begin by placing a nori sheet shiny side down on the bamboo mat. Spread a thin layer of seasoned rice over the nori, leaving a margin at the top. Add fillings along the bottom edge, then roll tightly using the bamboo mat, exerting even pressure to create a compact roll.<br><br>

    7. Experimenting with Variations:<br>
    While traditional sushi consists of rice, fish, and seaweed, don't be afraid to experiment with different ingredients and styles. Vegetarian options, such as avocado or cucumber rolls, are popular, as are fusion variations like spicy tuna or tempura shrimp rolls.<br><br>

    8. Serving and Enjoying:<br>
    Once the sushi rolls are assembled, slice them into bite-sized pieces using a sharp knife dipped in water to prevent sticking. Arrange the slices on a platter alongside soy sauce, wasabi, and pickled ginger. Savor the fruits of your labor with friends and family, appreciating the craftsmanship and cultural heritage of sushi.<br><br>

    <h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>
    <p>
    Sushi Rice – You’ll need Japanese short-grain rice, rice vinegar, sugar, and salt.
    <br>I often add kombu (kelp) for additional fragrance, but it is optional.
    <br>Nori (Seaweed) – We’ll use roasted sheets of nori seaweed (nori sheet).
    <br>For the best quality nori, look for the most expensive one available at your local
    <br>Asian grocery stores or online.
    <br>I get mine (imported from Japan) from my local Japanese store.
    <br>Ingredients – In Japan, seafood (raw or fresh) is the primary ingredient used in sushi.
    <br>Popular choices are salmon, tuna, shrimp, octopus, etc. Veggies such as carrots, cucumber, daikon radish, shiso leaves, etc. are also included in certain types of sushi.
    <br>Depending on the sushi, you can certainly work with whatever ingredients you prefer.
    <br>Sushi Accompaniments – We often serve soy sauce, wasabi, and gari (pickled ginger) alongside the sushi.
